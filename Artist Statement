Artist Statement:
This is a minimalistic album cover for a fake musical group called “Boy and Dog.” 
The paper background of the street, along with the drawings of the boy and the dog were all done by me. 
The price stickers, parental advisory, and barcode were found on google images. 
No colors besides grayscale are used besides on the torn paper and the price sticker to make them stand out. 
The fonts were both downloaded on fontsquirrel.com. 
I sketched the drawings with a pencil and then went over it with a brush pen. 
I tore the pages for aesthetic effect and also because erasing the background with feather looked more natural. 
A small amount of blur was added to the street background to bring more focus to the boy and the dog. 
The back cover features random song names and one image of the boy and the dog. 
The stickers were used mainly to reinforce the album cover style so that the image couldn’t be mistaken for something else. 
The brightness and contrast on all of the stickers were altered to look more natural.
I erased the “fedco” brand name using the color picker tool. 
All of the images were respectively resized to cover the amount of space I felt they needed to have. 
Using my own drawings gave me creative freedom and added a fun challenge to the project. 
The price sticker covers part of the album title because that’s where I imagined an employee would place the sticker.
